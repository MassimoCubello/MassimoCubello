## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Massimo!

Iâ€™m a web developer with a background in marketing and customer success. My journey into tech grew from years of helping people, solving problems, and telling stories that connect people. Now, Iâ€™m bringing those skills into development by building web experiences that are not only functional but also engaging, user-friendly, and human-centred.
